Hyperion: the open-source Java gameserver suite

### About

Hyperion is a Java gameserver suite server which aims to provide an  excellent, stable, quality base with advanced features such as update  server (to stream the cache to the client) and login server (for  multi-world support with cross world messaging).
 
The server has been developed completely from scratch, even the ISAAC  cipher code is scratch (as the one used by most is copyrighted Jagex -  from a deob).
 
There are lots of unique ideas: we are spending time making the server  good and high quality instead of cramming lots of features in a small  amount of time.
 
Also, for those working on their own servers, there is documentation on  the login, update and in-game protocol, and information about the  updating and walking procedures.
